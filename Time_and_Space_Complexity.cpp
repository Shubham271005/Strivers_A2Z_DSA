/*
    # What is Time Complexity? --> TC != Time taken
    --> Rate at which the time taken increases with
        respect to input size rather.

    * TC --> worst case scenario
    * avoid constants
    * avoid lower values
    *

    # Space Complexity --> memory space
    --> Auxiliary space --> space that you take to solve the problem
             +
        input space --> space that you take to store the input


    *** NEVER DO ANYTHING TO INPUT

    # CP --> Time Limit 1s --> 10^8 operations
                        2s --> 2 x 10^8 operations
                        5s --> 5 x 10^8 operations
